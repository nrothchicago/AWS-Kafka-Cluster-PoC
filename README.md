# AWS-Kafka-Cluster-PoC
Created a 3 node Kafka cluster in AWS with co-located Zookeeper and broker services on each EC2 Instance. Each server existed in a unique AZ for resiliency and had an XFS formatted EBS volume for storing Kafka data. 


TODO:
I've added images of the UI's and a rough draft of the architecture. I will add them to this readme with explanations and include configs files.
